# Data repository of the paper: Non-commodity agricultural price hedging with minimum tracking error portfolios: the case of Mexican Hass avocado

This repository is for the paper "Non-commodity agricultural price hedging with minimum tracking error portfolios: the case of Mexican Hass avocado" published in Agriculture in 2024.

In this repository, the reader can find the following material:

1. The input data and simulation results database in SQLite. This database has the following tables:
   1. EfficientFront: This table shows the simulated volatility and expected return of the tracking-error efficient frontier, along with the mean-variance ones. It also shows the risk, CVAR, and expected return of the minimum variance portfolio in the tracking-error / expected return locus. This portfolio minimizes the tracking error between the simulated portfolio and the avocado price.
   2. 
3. The original avocado historical price data from SNIIM
4. The mean premium-Hass avocado price used in the data base as inout data.
